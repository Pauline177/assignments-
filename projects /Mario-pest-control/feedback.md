Clean site and responsive.  I loved the creativity of changing the color styles as the screen width changed.  

Your naming conventions for classes and variables are awesome.  
Keeping them descriptive like you are, as we start to get into more complex code will help you a lot and reduce your development time.

Indentations and readability is great.  Keep that up.

If you're not going to be using code, let's delete it rather than commenting it out and leaving it in your code base.

Good work.  You're right where you need to be.
