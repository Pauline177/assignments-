            <h3>THE ROAD TO ENGLIGHTENMENT</h3>
            <p>
                Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags,
                incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.
            </p>
            <p>
                We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been
                achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WASP, and the major browser creators.
            </p>

                The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters.
                Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion.
                Become one with the web.
            </p>
            <h3> SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h3>
            <p>
                There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire,
                and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking
                on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing
                that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be
                illustrated
                in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed
                in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure.
                Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.
            </p>

            <div class="lightGreenBackground">
                <h3>PARTICIPATION</h3>
                <p>
                    Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong CSS skills
                    are necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even CSS novices can use
                    them
                    as starting points. Please see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working
                    with CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem daunting
                    at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use
                    the sample files as a guide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your
                    masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web server
                    under your control.
                    Send us a link to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we
                    will download it and place it on our server.
                </p>
                <h3> BENEFITS </h3>
                <p>
                    Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people
                    how amazing
                    CSS really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today,
                    learning tool
                    for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>REQUIREMENTS </h3>
            <p>
                Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to
                widely-supported elements only,
                or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS and not
                the latest bleeding-edge
                tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your CSS
                validates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by now. When sticking
                to the guidelines you
                should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of
                user agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may
                not be possible across
                every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least
                IE9+ and the latest Chrome,
                Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).

                We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable
                material to a minimum,
                and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual
                themes to your work. We’re well past the point of needing another garden-related design.
            </p>

                This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics
                (with limited exceptions,
                see submission guidelines), but we ask you release your CSS under a Creative
                Commons license identical to the one on this site so that others may learn from your work.
