            <div>
                Some of the few reasons why you should consider introducing beets to your diet.
                <ul>
                    <li>Keeps your blood pressure in check</li>
                    <li>Has many nutrients in low colories</li>
                    <li>Can improve your digestive health</li>
                    <li>Can help you loose weight</li>
                </ul>
                I have made this because I think it is some helpful information, and want to show my friends that beets aren't so bad.
